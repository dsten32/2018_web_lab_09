        <!-- IMPORTANT: Notice the action attribute specifies a relative URL.
             Whenever you linking to files in your servlet project, make sure
             you use relative paths. Also remember that if your path has a
             leading '/' character, that URL will be interpreted as being
             relative to the root of the server, NOT relative to the root of
             your project. Whilst during development these might mean the same
             thing, this will not be the case later on, so get in the habit of
             avoiding those kinds of URL.                                      -->
